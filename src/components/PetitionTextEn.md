The summer pedestrianization of Wellington has received acclaim from residents, public officials, and the media. Despite the logistics of installation and dismantling the event each year, commerce, transit and general function are all maintained during the event.

In the interests of the community, we are calling to pedestrianize this street permanently.

This proposal would make Verdun a more pleasant, healthy, ecological, equitable, accessible, child-friendly, and socially integrated neighbourhood aligned with our community's ambitions and values.

It is in accordance with Article 24(d) of the *Montréal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities* which aims to promote active mobility by limiting the use of automobiles in an urban milieu.

A consultation would allow residents to affirm their rights and ownership of public space without the outsized influence of passing drivers and business interests.

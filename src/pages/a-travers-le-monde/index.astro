        In 2018, the plaza was expanded to 400 metres in length. Then in 2022, a USD$7 million renovation was completed. Along with new benches, bike racks, a stage for community events, vegetation and trees, the city raised the street with granite pavers for universal wheelchair and stroller accessibility. 

        “The creation of the Pedestrian Plaza was a risk our administration took when first elected as there was significant pushback, but I think over time it has become clear to everyone that the changes we made there have attracted more people, allowed more businesses to open, and created a destination spot for visitors and residents,” said Mayor Steven Fulop.

        At its conception, the idea of a pedestrian street was not generally accepted. The slogan and rallying cry was that "Danes are not Italians", as Copenhagen lacked the social culture seen in such places in the Mediterranean. People feared the change would be a disaster for the businesses in the street. 
        
        The town planner, Alfred Wassard, even faced death threats. Visionary political decision-making was needed, and The determination of key politicians was vital for this transformation to occur.

The following year, the street was pedestrianized for a week, with transit added on surrounding streets. The experiment was an obvious success. 
        
        After years of dialogue and planning, the street was then made into a permanent pedestrian street. Today, millions of visitors come to socialize, celebrate, pass time, and shop at one of over a hundred shops and restaurants on the street.`,

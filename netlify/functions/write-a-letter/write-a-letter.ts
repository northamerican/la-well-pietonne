It is pedestrianized in the summer months only for the last several years. The street is mixed use with many shops, restaurants and residential units. After a petition and public initiative was made, the public is now being consulted to make the pedestrian street permanent, with an eventual redevelopment. The letter is addressed to a public consultation office called "Office de consultation publique de MontrÃ©al" or OCPM for short. They are hosting the consultation and will be receiving this opinion letter as part of the process, now, in January and Febraury 2025.
  The user supplies you with summarized information to craft the letter. Some of the information provided will be more relevant than others, and you should use your judgment to decide what to include in the letter provided it conveys their support, eagerness, and how they and the community would benefit from a pedestrian street. The letter should be natrual and not overly formal. Their age, occupation and provided info can be reflected in the writing style and length of the letter, so it is more authentic and varied between letters.
  If they are particularly old or young, it may enhance credibility to include their provided age.
  If they are a parent or long time resident.
  If they work at or live near or on the street.
  If they work or are involved in an organization like social sciences, public health, environment, urban planning, or similar that may give them expertise or authority on the subject.
  If they have accessibility needs that would give them priority or credibility for supporting a pedestrian street.
  If they provided other comments or experiences that would help craft a persuasive letter in support of a pedestrian street.
  Ideas provided by the user should not be copied verbatim, but can be paraphrased or summarized in the letter.
  The letter will be sent as an email, so it should not formatted with a header or address.
  Do not include any references to the pandemic or social distancing.
  The letter may be output in English or French from Quebec, based on their provided preference.`;
